# Alejandro Vázquez Góngora 👋
**Senior .NET & Cloud Engineer · Software Architect · Cloud Solutions Engineer**

I help teams **design, build, and modernize** enterprise-grade systems using **cloud-native .NET**, with a strong focus on **scalability, reliability, and clean architecture**.

- 🧠 **15+ years** building production software end-to-end  
- 🚀 **50+ projects delivered** across multiple industries  
- ✅ Built for **mission-critical** systems: integrations, data pipelines, and operational excellence  
- 🌐 Spanish (native) · English (bilingual)

## What I’m great at
- **Architecture + delivery**: turn ambiguous requirements into clear system designs and working software  
- **Modernization**: legacy .NET Framework → modern .NET (incremental migration, not risky rewrites)  
- **Integrations**: partner APIs, 3rd-party systems, retries/DLQ, idempotency, and observability  
- **Event-driven systems**: queues/topics, backoff, workflows, and resilient async processing  
- **DevOps-minded engineering**: CI/CD, IaC, monitoring, and production readiness

## Services (how I can help)
- **.NET Architecture & Engineering** (Clean Architecture, CQRS, DDD, microservices)
- **Cloud-Native Architecture** on AWS / Azure (serverless, containers, IaC)
- **.NET Modernization & Re-architecture** (framework-to-modern, decomposition, migration strategy)
- **Technical Leadership & Architecture Guidance** (mentoring, standards, reviews, decision-making)
- **DevOps & Automation** (pipelines, deployment strategy, release hardening)

## Tech stack
**Backend**
- C# · .NET (Framework → modern .NET) · ASP.NET Core · REST · gRPC (when it fits)
- Messaging & realtime patterns (queues, pub/sub, SignalR-style approaches)

**Cloud**
- AWS: Lambda · ECS/Fargate · SQS/SNS · EventBridge · API Gateway · DynamoDB · S3 · CloudWatch
- Azure: App Services · Functions · Logic Apps · Storage · SQL DB

**Data**
- SQL Server (T-SQL, SPs) · PostgreSQL · Oracle · MySQL  
- NoSQL: DynamoDB · MongoDB · Redis

**DevOps**
- Azure DevOps · Jenkins · Octopus Deploy · Docker · Git · Jira  
- IaC: AWS CDK (TypeScript) / CloudFormation (and Terraform when needed)

## Principles I build with
- **Clean Architecture** and pragmatic **DDD** (clear boundaries, testability, maintainability)
- **Resilience by default**: timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, DLQ, replay, and idempotency
- **Observability as a feature**: logs, metrics, traces, SLO-oriented thinking
- **Incremental modernization**: strangler patterns, safe migrations, measurable milestones

## Selected case studies

- **Supply-chain microservices platform**  
  Designed a .NET microservices platform with event-driven workflows, integrating external logistics providers with robust error handling and reliability patterns.

- **Enterprise applications platform**  
  Established architectural standards and reusable components to speed up delivery while improving code quality and consistency across teams.

- **Document workflow modernization**  
  Re-architected an older system into a maintainable layered design and introduced automated workflow orchestration for document lifecycle processes.
